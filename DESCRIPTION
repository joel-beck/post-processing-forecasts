Description: 
    The `postforecasts` package implements various methods to adjust 
    Time Series forecasts with a particular focus on quantile predictions.
    Although the procedures can be used for general forecasting data, the project 
    is motivated by and tailored to the European Covid-19 Forecast Hub data 
    (https://covid19forecasthub.eu/).
