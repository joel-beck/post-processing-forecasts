# Analysis Tools

Data Analysis is inherently build upon two fundamental components: High Quality Data that allows to gain insight into the underlying data generating process and a structured and reproducible way to extract information out of the collected data.

\Cref{data} introduces the two data sets we worked with while \Cref{package} provides an overview about the `postforecasts` package, a unified framework to apply and analyze various post-processing techniques.



## Data & Methodology {#data}

This section first introduces the two data sources that all of our analysis is based on.
The final paragraphs continue with a description of our evaluation procedure from a theoretical point of view.



### UK Covid-19 Crowd Forecasting Challenge

As part of an ongoing research project by the [EpiForecasts](https://epiforecasts.io/) group at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, the [UK Covid-19 Crowd Forecasting Challenge](https://www.crowdforecastr.org/2021/05/11/uk-challenge/) consisted of submitting weekly predictions of Covid-19 Cases and Deaths in the United Kingdom in $2021$.
The challenge was not restricted to experienced researchers in the field but rather intended to collect quantile predictions for the upcoming four weeks by non-expert individuals.

One of the main motivations was to gather evidence for or against the hypothesis that humans are highly capable of precise *point forecasts*.
Yet, at the same time, they tend to be too confident in their beliefs such that prediction *intervals* are chosen too narrow.
In fact, this tendency represents one motivation for post-processing: Extract valuable information from point forecasts and adjust the corresponding prediction intervals with a systematic correction procedure.

In case of individuals that are unfamiliar with statistical methodology, specifying forecasts for very specific quantiles of the predictive distribution might lead to inconsistencies.
Therefore all participants could determine an uncertainty parameter around their median prediction via an interactive web application such that all quantile predictions could be concluded in an automatic fashion.
Note that this procedure leads to *symmetric* forecast intervals.

The results of the $12$-week challenge are [publicly available](https://epiforecasts.io/uk-challenge/).


### European Covid-19 Forecast Hub

According to their [webpage](https://covid19forecasthub.eu/index.html) the European Covid-19 Forecast Hub collects "short-term forecasts of Covid-19 cases and deaths across Europe, created by a multitude of infectious disease modelling teams". 

In contrast to the compact UK data described above, the European Forecast Hub data contains almost two million observations for over $20$ European countries.
Further, the forecasters are knowledgeable research groups that submit their weekly predictions based on statistical models.
Although the data collection continues in regular frequency up to this day, our data set is limited to a $32$-week span from March $2021$ until October $2021$.

The overall structure of the two data sets introduced above is very similar.
Since we will refer to some particularly important columns by name frequently throughout the next chapters, they are briefly described here:

- `location`: The country for which the forecasts were submitted.
Equals `GB` for the UK data. Our analysis for the European Forecast Hub data selects $18$ different European countries.

- `model`: The forecaster (group).
Mostly (non-expert) individuals for the UK data and international research groups for the European Forecast Hub.

- `target_type`: Either Covid-19 Cases or Covid-19 Deaths.

- `horizon`: The time horizon how far in advance the predictions were submitted.
Ranges from $1$ week-ahead to $4$ weeks-ahead.

- `forecast_date`: The exact date when the forecasts were submitted. 

- `target_end_date`: The exact date for which the forecasts were submitted.

- `quantile`: One of $23$ different quantile values ranging from $0.01$ to $0.99$.

- `prediction`: The predicted value for one specific combination of the variables above.

- `true_value`: The actual, observed number of Covid-19 Cases or Deaths. 
This value is repeated $23$ times, once for each quantile value. 



### Weighted Interval Score {#wis}

In order to quantify if the post-processed prediction intervals improve the original forecasts we chose the *Weighted Interval Score* (WIS) [@bracher2021] as our evaluation metric.
The WIS is a so-called *Proper Scoring Rule* [@gneiting2007]: It incentivizes the forecaster to state their true best belief and cannot be manipulated in favour of own interests.
It combines measures for interval *sharpness* as well as *overprediction* and *underprediction* and can thus be understood as a trade-off between interval *coverage* and *precision*.

More specifically, for a given quantile level $\alpha$, true observed value $y$ as well as lower bound $l$ and upper bound $u$ of the corresponding $(1 - \alpha) \cdot 100$% prediction interval, the **Interval Score** according to @bracher2021 is computed as 
<!--  -->
$$
\begin{aligned}
IS_\alpha(y) 
= (u-l) + \frac{2}{\alpha} \cdot (l-y) \cdot \mathbbm{1} (y \leq l) + \frac{2}{\alpha} \cdot (y-u) \cdot \mathbbm{1}(y \geq u). 
\end{aligned}
$$
<!--  -->
The penalties $\frac{2}{\alpha} \cdot (l-y)$ and $\frac{2}{\alpha} \cdot (y-u)$ for over- and underprediction are thus influenced by two components:

- The penalty gets larger for increasing distance of the true value $y$ to the lower or upper bound, given that $y$ is not contained in the interval.

- The penalty gets larger for smaller values of $\alpha$, i.e. for higher nominal coverage levels $(1 - \alpha)$.

A set of $K$ Interval Scores with different quantile levels $\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_K$ can be aggregated to a single number, the **Weighted Interval Score**:
<!--  -->
$$
\begin{aligned}
WIS(y) = \frac{1}{K + 0.5} \cdot (w_0 \cdot |y - m| + \sum_{k = 1}^{K} w_k \cdot IS_{\alpha}(y)),
\end{aligned}
$$
<!-- -->
where $m$ represents the predicted median.

Thus, as the name suggests, the Weighted Interval Score is a weighted sum of the individual Interval Scores.
The weights $w_k$ are typically chosen as $w_k = \frac{\alpha_k}{ 2}$ and the weight $w_0$ for the deviation of the median is usually set to $0.5$.



### Time Series Cross Validation

Just like any statistical model the post-processing methods must be evaluated on *out-of-sample* data.
Rather than starting from the raw data, i.e. the observed Covid-19 Cases and Deaths, our data sets already consist of existing quantile predictions.
As a consequence, no part of our data set must be dedicated to fitting the quantile regression models in the first place. 

Our evaluation procedure can therefore be split into two steps:

1.  Use a *training set* to learn parameters of the post-processing procedure in consideration.

2.  Use a *validation set* to evaluate how the learned parameters generalize to unseen data.

Instead of a hard cut-off between the splits we used *Time Series Cross Validation* to leverage a higher fraction of the data set for training.
In contrast to classical Cross Validation for independent and identically distributed data, Time Series Cross Validation iterates through the data set along the time dimension one step at a time.

The process is nicely illustrated in \Cref{fig:ch1-cv}^[Image Source: https://otexts.com/fpp3/tscv.html [@hyndman2021].].

```{r, ch1-cv, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.cap="Time Series Cross Validation"}
knitr::include_graphics(
  here::here("term_paper", "images", "cv-hyndman.png"),
  auto_pdf = TRUE
)
```

At each iteration the validation set is composed of the one step ahead prediction based on all observations prior to and including the current time point.
The algorithm typically starts with a minimum number of observations as the initial training set, which can be considered a hyperparameter that has to be specified at the beginning of training.




## The `postforecasts` Package {#package}

One core aspect of our project was the development of a fully functional package in the statistical programming language `R` [@R-base] that unites a collection of different post-processing algorithms into a well-designed and user friendly interface.
This section can be understood as a compact guide how to use our package effectively and explains some of the thought process that went into the implementation.
It is worth noting that the `postforecasts` package adheres to all formal requirements for an R package such that `RCMDCHECK` does not produce any warnings or errors.
The source code is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nikosbosse/post-processing-forecasts).



### Overview {#overview}

The `postforecasts` functions that are meant to be visible to the end-user can be grouped into three categories:

1.  Exploratory

    The `plot_quantiles()`, `plot_intervals()` and `plot_intervals_grid()` functions visualize the development of true Covid-19 Cases and Deaths over time as well as corresponding original and post-processed quantile predictions.

2.  Model Fitting

    The `update_predictions()` function is the workhorse of the entire `postforecasts` package.
    It specifies both the raw data and the post-processing method(s) that should be applied to this data set.
    The function returns a list of $k+1$ equally shaped data frames for $k$ selected post-processing methods where the first element is given by the original, possibly filtered, data frame.

    All list elements can be analyzed separately or collectively by stacking them into one large data frame with the `collect_predictions()` function.
    The combined data frame is designed to work well with analysis functions of the [scoringutils](https://epiforecasts.io/scoringutils/) package [@R-scoringutils].
    If multiple post-processing methods are applied, an ensemble model of all selected methods can be added via the `add_ensemble()` function, which lets the user access both the weighted ensemble predictions and a data frame with the corresponding weights.
    The ensemble approach will be further explained in \Cref{comparison} .

3.  Evaluation

    As noted in \Cref{data}  the Weighted Interval Score is our primary metric to evaluate the *quality* of prediction intervals.
    The `score()` function of the `scoringutils` package computes this quantity for each observation in the data set which can then be aggregated by the related `summarise_scores()` function.
    
    Depending on the *granularity* of the aggregation the output might contain many interval scores of vastly different magnitudes.
    To simplify interpretation the `eval_methods()` function computes *relative* or *percentage* changes in the Weighted Interval Score for each selected method compared to the original quantile predictions.
    Further, these relative changes can be visualized by the `plot_eval()` function.

The following section demonstrates the complete workflow described above to give an impression of the *interaction* between all implemented functions.



### Workflow {#workflow}

We use the Covid-19 data for Germany in $2021$ that is provided by the European Forecast Hub.

```{r, include=FALSE}
hub_1 <- readr::read_csv(here::here("data_modified", "hub_data_1_incidences.csv"))
hub_2 <- readr::read_csv(here::here("data_modified", "hub_data_2_incidences.csv"))
hub_3 <- readr::read_csv(here::here("data_modified", "hub_data_3_incidences.csv"))

hub <- dplyr::bind_rows(hub_1, hub_2, hub_3)

hub_germany <- hub |>
  dplyr::filter(location == "DE") |>
  dplyr::distinct(model, target_end_date, target_type, quantile, horizon,
    .keep_all = TRUE
  )
```

\Cref{fig:ch1-quantiles-germany} illustrates the $5$%, $20$% $80$% and $95$% quantile predictions of the `EuroCOVIDhub-ensemble` during the summer months of $2021$ in Germany.

```{r, ch1-quantiles-germany, fig.cap="Original Quantile Predictions for Covid-19 Cases and Deaths in Germany 2021"}
plot_quantiles(
  hub_germany,
  model = "EuroCOVIDhub-ensemble", quantiles = c(0.05, 0.2, 0.8, 0.95)
)
```

The original predictions look quite noisy overall with the clear trend that uncertainty and, hence, the interval width increases with growing forecast horizons.
We want to analyze if one particular post-processing method, *Conformalized Quantile Regression* which is explained in much more detail in \Cref{cqr}, improves the predictive performance for this model on a validation set by computing the Weighted Interval Scores for Covid Cases and Covid Deaths separately:

```{r}
df_updated <- update_predictions(
  hub_germany,
  methods = "cqr", models = "EuroCOVIDhub-ensemble", cv_init_training = 0.5
)
df_combined <- collect_predictions(df_updated)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
df_combined |>
  extract_validation_set() |>
  scoringutils::score() |>
  scoringutils::summarise_scores(by = c("method", "target_type"))
```

```{r, ch1-wis-table, echo=FALSE}
df_combined |>
  extract_validation_set() |>
  scoringutils::score() |>
  scoringutils::summarise_scores(by = c("method", "target_type")) |>
  dplyr::select(method:dispersion) |>
  dplyr::arrange(target_type) |>
  kableExtra::kbl(
    digits = 2, align = "c", booktabs = TRUE,
    caption = "Comparison of the Weighted Interval Score after CQR Adjustments"
  ) |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling(position = "center", full_width = FALSE)
```

\Cref{tab:ch1-wis-table} shows that CQR improved the Weighted Interval Score for Covid Cases on the validation set, whereas the predictive performance for Covid Deaths dropped slightly.

The `update_predictions()` and `collect_predictions()` combination immediately generalize to multiple post-processing methods.
The only syntax change is a vector input of strings for the `methods` argument instead of a single string.
Hence, if not desired, the user does not have to worry about which input and output features each method requires in its raw form nor how exactly each method is implemented.
This design allows for maximum syntactic consistency through masking internal functionality.

Moreover, the `update_predictions()` function automatically takes care of *quantile crossing* [@bassett1982] by reordering the output predictions in increasing quantile order.
The `cv_init_training` parameter specifies the fraction of observations that is used for the pure training set before starting the Time Series Cross Validation process.

As seen in \Cref{tab:ch1-wis-table} CQR increases the *dispersion* of the predictions for Cases significantly.
One example of these wider intervals is visualized in \Cref{fig:ch1-intervals-germany}.

```{r, ch1-intervals-germany, fig.cap="Original and CQR-adjusted Prediction Intervals for Covid-19 Cases in Germany", out.width="80%"}
plot_intervals(df_combined, target_type = "Cases", horizon = 2, quantile = 0.05)
```

Indeed, the 2 weeks-ahead $90$% prediction intervals for Covid Cases in Germany are expanded by CQR.
The grey dashed line indicates the end of the training set within the Cross Validation as specified by the `cv_init_training` parameter.

Recall from \Cref{fig:ch1-quantiles-germany} that prediction uncertainty increases with larger forecast horizons.
Similarly, CQR adjustments also increase in size for forecasts that are submitted further in advance, which can be seen in \Cref{fig:ch1-intervalsgrid-germany} along the horizontal dimension.
Interestingly, CQR expands the intervals only for Cases whereas the forecasts for Deaths are narrowed!

```{r, ch1-intervalsgrid-germany, fig.cap="Original and CQR-adjusted Prediction Intervals for different Forecast Horizons"}
plot_intervals_grid(df_combined, facet_by = "horizon", quantiles = 0.05)
```

Besides the target type (Cases or Deaths), it is also useful to compare CQR effects across forecast horizons or quantiles.
Quite intuitively, CQR generally has a stronger *relative* benefit for large time horizons and extreme quantiles, where the original forecaster faced a greater uncertainty.
\Cref{fig:ch1-eval-germany} illustrates how, in special cases like this one, the effect on the validation set can show rather mixed trends due to disadvantageous adjustments for the two and three weeks-ahead $98$% prediction intervals.

```{r, ch1-eval-germany, fig.cap="Relative Changes in the WIS through CQR for all Quantile-Horizon combinations", out.width="80%"}
df_eval <- eval_methods(df_combined, summarise_by = c("quantile", "horizon"))
plot_eval(df_eval)
```
