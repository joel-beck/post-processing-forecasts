# Conclusion {-}


- developed a fully functional R package that is easily extendable with little changes in the user interface

- explained key characteristics of each method

- revealed limitations, linked theory to empirical findings by analyzing the effect of potential shortcomings on real data and 

- proposed modifications which could solve these limitations and compared their out-of-sample performance with the original versions

- analyzed similarities and differences within and between the two families of methods

- showed how combining information into an ensemble method leads to best performance

- faced computational bottlenecks and thus leveraged parallel computing 


- multiple ways to extend out work

- most straightforwar way: research and implement more methods 

- understand inner workings of post-processing methods better by comparing their performance across different data sets or subsets of a large data set

- apply our methods to a more general forecasting domain that is unrelated of Covid-19 predictions and observe which methods generalize best to new contexts

- collaborate with other resarch groups to integrate our package into a general framework for time series forecasts that unites the entire process of data preprocessing, constructing prediction models and fine tune results with post-processing

- we believe that the research with respect to developing and understanding post-processing of time series forecasts is far from saturated and there remain lots of opportunities to consolidate and expand our knowledge
